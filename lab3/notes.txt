8 - The length of the first TCP segment is 565Bytes, and the length of the following 5 is 1460Bytes.
6. The (relative) sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST request is 1.
5. The sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu in reply to the SYN is 0, and the value of the ACK field is 1. The corresponding flags are set (both SYN and ACK)
